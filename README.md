Hi! I'm Veronica. I have a Bachelor's Degree from Carnegie Mellon and I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan.

I care about minority representation in software engineering, specifically focusing on women and people with disabilities. I mainly work on accessibility research, but I'm also interested in:

- 🤖🚗 anything autonomous
- 🌏🍃 environmental conservation
